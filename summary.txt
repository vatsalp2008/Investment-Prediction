Stock	MAE (↓)	RMSE (↓)	Comments
AAPL	8.11	11.35	Acceptable — decent prediction, may improve with hyperparameter tuning.
AMZN	7.17	8.79	Performing well.
GC=F	44.31	57.64	High error — Gold is volatile and harder to model with LSTM.
GOOGL	6.13	7.19	One of the best — very accurate predictions.
MSFT	8.62	11.02	Moderate — good for basic predictions.
NVDA	7.60	9.26	Also decent. May benefit from a more complex model.
TSLA	18.82	24.53	Higher error — Tesla's price is highly volatile.

✅ GOOGL and AMZN have strong accuracy.

✅ AAPL, NVDA, MSFT are moderately accurate — acceptable for general trends.

⚠️ GC=F (Gold) and TSLA are more volatile, leading to higher error."
